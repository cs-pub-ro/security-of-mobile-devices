# Mobile UI Interface

The user interface (UI) can be the cause of functionality or security issues.
Attackers may provide hidden, overlapped, small size, difficult to spot UI components that cause the user to lose data or do malicious actions.
UI security is concerned with providing a safe environment for the user such that its actions will not have unintended effects.

User interface security can be achieved, apart from analysis, via user interface testing, or UI exercising.
In this case, an application is "exercised" with random events (clicks, gestures) being used for activity screens in applications.

UI exercising or testing is useful both for security and robustness of the application, determining whether there are user actions that cause the application to malfunction.

One of the tools for UI exercising in the mobile (and web world) is [Appium](https://appium.io/).
There are native mobile testing frameworks as well that may also integrate with Appium.

## Appium

As noted in its [landing page](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/), Appium is an open-source project and ecosystem of related software, designed to facilitate UI automation of many app platforms.
[This article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pros-cons-different-ui-automation-test-tools-appium-craig-risi/) provides and overview of the advantages and downsides of using Appium.

## Task 1: Android UI Automator

## Task 2: Monkey

Follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@umarauna/android-testing-ui-using-application-exerciser-monkey-d1e5f3234acc) to install and configure Monkey and test an application on the Android emulator.

## Task 3: Appium

Follow [these instructions](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/) to install Appium on your system and do initial tests.

## Task 4: Test Appium with an Android App in the Emulator

Use an application of your preference and exercise it using Appium.

## Task 5: Test Appium with an App on your Mobile Device

Use your mobile device to exercise an application on it using Appium.
Both iOS and Android devices should work.
