# iOS Static Analysis

## Static Analysis of `.ipa` files Using MobSF

For this task we aim to understand the reports generated by [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF).

**Prerequisites**: Install Docker on a Linux host following [these steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).
You can skip this step if you have Docker already installed.

Run MobSF Docker image:

```console
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

Access the MobSF web interface at http://localhost:8000

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed Docker on another system, use the link: http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:8000

Upload an `.ipa` file to test, preferably a vulnerable one, such as [DVIA-v2](https://github.com/prateek147/DVIA-v2/raw/master/DVIA-v2-swift.ipa).

Follow the steps [in this walkthrough](https://inesmartins.github.io/mobsf-ipa-binary-analysis-step-by-step/index.html) to understand the report generated by MobSF.

## iLEAPP

[iLEAPP](https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP) is a tool used as part of [DFIR](https://www.cybereason.com/fundamentals/what-is-dfir) (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) to analyze iOS filesystem archives and extract information and forensics data.

Install iLEAPP on your system by following the instructions in the repository.
You can install it on any platform, you needn't install it on a macOS virtual machine.
