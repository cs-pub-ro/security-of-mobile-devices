# Mobile Development and Analysis Environment

We aim to create our very first Android and iOS applications and do the basic analysis.

We use the Android Emulator in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
We use the iOS Simulator in Xcode.

## Android Environment

Follow the steps [here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/smd/laboratoare/00#android_environment) to install and set up Android Studio.
And then run a simple "Hello, World!" app using the Android Emulator.

Then, follow the steps [here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/smd/laboratoare/01#task_6_-_use_adb_to_transfer_files_and_install_apps) to use ADB to connect to the emulated Android device.

## iOS Environment

Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/cs-pub-ro/security-of-mobile-devices/tree/master/guides/macos-vm) to install a macOS virtual machine.

Follow the steps [here](https://www.appcoda.com/learnuikit/build-your-first-app.html) to build and run a simple "Hello, World!" app using the Xcode Simulator.

Use the [command-line tools of Xcode](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/) to build and run the "Hello, World!" app.
See instructions [here](https://help.perfecto.io/perfecto-help/content/perfecto/automation-testing/create_an_ios_simulator_build.htm).

Use `lldb` to debug an application in the Xcode Simulator.
See instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/jerrymarino/1f9eb6a06c423f9744ea297d80193a9b).
