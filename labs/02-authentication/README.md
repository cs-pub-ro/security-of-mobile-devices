# Authentication on Mobile Devices and Applications

We investigate and work with authentication for devices and applications on mobile platforms.
We also look at key storage & management and encryption, digital signing and integrity on mobile platforms.

## Android

### Authentication

Create an Android application that requires fingerprint / biometric authentication to show a message.

### Encryption

Create an Android application that encrypts a message using AES.

**Bonus**: Create an Android application that encrypts a message with RSA (using the public key).

**Bonus**: Create an Android application that digitally signs a message with RSA (using the private key).

## iOS

### Authentication

Create an iOS application that requires TouchID and / or FaceID authentication to show a message.
